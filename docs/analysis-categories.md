## Overview

Each repository is analyzed across **6 categories** with specific checks for files, configurations, and best practices.

| Category | Focus Area | Weight |
|----------|------------|--------|
| 📚 Docs & Onboarding | Documentation quality | 20% |
| ⚡ Developer Experience | Build & development setup | 20% |
| 🔄 CI/CD | Automation pipelines | 20% |
| 🧪 Quality & Tests | Testing & code quality | 15% |
| 📋 Governance | Project policies | 15% |
| 🔐 Security | Security practices | 10% |

---

## Category Weights

The overall health score is calculated using weighted averages:

```
Health Score = (Docs × 0.20) + (DX × 0.20) + (CI/CD × 0.20) 
             + (Tests × 0.15) + (Governance × 0.15) + (Security × 0.10)
```

Each category starts at 100% and deductions are made for missing elements:
- **P0 finding:** −30 points
- **P1 finding:** −15 points
- **P2 finding:** −5 points

---

## 📚 Docs & Onboarding

## Scoring Algorithm

Each category is scored independently:

```python
category_score = 100

for finding in category_findings:
    if finding.priority == "P0":
        category_score -= 30
    elif finding.priority == "P1":
        category_score -= 15
    elif finding.priority == "P2":
        category_score -= 5

category_score = max(0, category_score)  # Floor at 0%
```

Overall score uses weighted average:

```python
overall_score = (
    docs_score * 0.20 +
    dx_score * 0.20 +
    cicd_score * 0.20 +
    tests_score * 0.15 +
    governance_score * 0.15 +
    security_score * 0.10
)
```
